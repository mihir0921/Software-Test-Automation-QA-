How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?
An unauthorized user needs to be properly authenticated and approved before they may implement data security protection (use of strict password policy, 2-factor authentication). It is important to take precautions to ensure that no data leaks occur when sending data from one source to another using secure channels (HTTPS) and while employing data encryption.


How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?
Imagine that I wanted to create a straightforward software that would allow me to gather and alter material and citations from books and websites. Aiming the application at PhD students is important. This is a wonderful good project to work on, but if I didn't do my homework, I might come up with ideas that don't make sense: Its usage is not quite clear: PhD students will use the application since they need to maintain references. Nonetheless, it should resemble other versions of the same software and offer a novel reference function based on scanning a book's barcode. Some patterns I discovered during my research to gather and modify references with other students and the lecturer can help me with future design ideas.


How do I approach designing software?
Structured design is the idea of breaking down the issue into a manageable number of solution components. The design of the solution is essentially the focus. A structured design has the benefit of improving understanding of the problem's solution. Moreover, structured design makes it simpler for the designer to pinpoint the issue more precisely.
